# VM for OpenMBEE MMS

A vagrant-based virtual machine (VM) for setting up the [Open Model Based Engineering Environment (OpenMBEE)][openmbee]
[Model Management System (MMS)][mms].  This VM helps instantiate the [OpenMBEE MMS Docker Image][docker-image].

> This virtual machine was developed to facilitate the installation of the OpenMBEE MMS server.
It is intended as a stop-gap solution until a scalable containerized version of the OpenMBEE MMS
server can be developed, e.g., using [Kubernetes][kubernetes].

As of Jan 24, 2020, this VM works with [OpenMBEE MMS Docker Image][docker-image] v3.4.2 (latest) and has been successfully deployed and tested in a local Ubuntu 18.04 server; other versions have not been tested.  Additionally, the [Model Development Kit (MDK)][mdk] v4.1.3 plugin for MagicDraw][magicdraw] successfully works with the MMS server this repo provisions.


## Prerequisites
1. Install [Vagrant][vagrant].

2. Install [VirtualBox][virtualbox].


## Installation
1. Clone this repository:
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/MJDiaz89/openmbee-vm.git
    ```

2. Provision the virtual machine:
    ```
    cd openmbee-vm
    vagrant up
    ```

> The first time you run this, it will take some time to start all the services, so please be patient.

## Usage

### Login to Alfresco
    http://127.0.0.1:8080/share/page/
using `admin` as both the username and the password.

### Login to View Editor
You can login to the OpenMBEE [View Editor][view-editor] by going to:

    http://127.0.0.1:8080/alfresco/mmsapp/mms.html#/login

and using `admin` as both the username and the password.

> View Editor **does not** come with this repo yet -- perhaps coming soon.

### Access REST API
You can access the Swagger UI at

    http://127.0.0.1:8080/alfresco/mms/swagger-ui/index.html


### Test MMS via REST 
Use the following curl commands to post an initial organization + project:
```
curl -w "\n%{http_code}\n" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -u admin:admin --data '{"orgs": [{"id": "vetestorg", "name": "vetestorg"}]}' -X POST "http://localhost:8080/alfresco/service/orgs"
curl -w "\n%{http_code}\n" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -u admin:admin --data '{"projects": [{"id": "vetestproj","name": "vetestproj","orgId": "vetestorg", "type": "Project"}]}' -X POST "http://localhost:8080/alfresco/service/orgs/vetestorg/projects"
```

Make sure the server accepted them:
````
curl -w "\n%{http_code}\n" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -u admin:admin -X GET "http://localhost:8080/alfresco/service/orgs"
curl -w "\n%{http_code}\n" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -u admin:admin -X GET "http://localhost:8080/alfresco/service/orgs/vetestorg/projects"
````


### Troubleshoot
If that URL is not responding, make sure [Alfresco][alfresco] is running, by going to:

    http://127.0.0.1:8080/alfresco

If that is not working, checkout the `docker-compose` logs by:

1. SSH'ing into the VM:

    ```
    vagrant ssh
    ```

2. And inspecting the logs:

    ```
    docker-compose -f /vagrant/docker-compose.yml --project-directory /vagrant logs
    ```
    
    Alternatively, a user can use the `dc` alias command:
    
    ```
    dc logs
    ``` 
    
    or

    ```
    dc logs --follow --tail 0
    ```

    to inspect how the server is handeling requests and responses.

3. Make sure the docker containers are actually running:
    ```
    dc ps
    ```

    For more information on the custom commands, type:
    
    ```
    commands
    ``` 

4. Make sure you can access Tomcat at
   ```
   http://127.0.0.1:8080
   ```
   and that you see all services running at
   ```
   http://127.0.0.1:8080/manager/html/list
   ```
   authenticate with 
   ```
   user: admin
   password: tomcatadmin
   ```

### Important Notice
For this server to be useful, you will need to have: [MagicDraw][magicdraw], the
[Model Development Kit (MDK)][mdk] plugin, and a SysML model.

As of Jan 24, 2020, the latest MDK plugin version for MagicDraw is 4.1.3 and can be found here:
